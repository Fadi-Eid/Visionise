Face detection and automatic tracking camera mount.

This project is intended to solve the problem of human dependence when shooting video.
From self recording, to professional conference recordings, this face tracking camera mount
can be used to effectively eep the subject at the center of the frame.
Testing and improvements on the software and hardware resulted in a smooth tracker which is 
very fault tolerant and can precisely detect the face to be tracked.

The position (x-coordinates) of the face is sent serially to a microcontroller connected 
to the PC running the Python program for it to control the mount.

The library used for face detection is lighweight and can run on a CPU at about 
30 FPS at 460p - 720p image quality.
